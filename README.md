> # Abstract
Femoral and carotid plaque histologic characteristics and associated clinical courses differ considerably, but few molecular insights exist into immunologic factors associated with these differences. To address this gap, we investigated distinct, cell-specific transcriptional programs in freshly excised human femoral vs. carotid plaques using single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (scRNA-seq). We observed profound B cell and anti-inflammatory myeloid cell biases in femoral plaque compared with carotid plaque. Femoral plaques had significantly higher proportions of anti-inflammatory foam cell-like macrophages, resident-like macrophages, and B cells (particularly anti-inflammatory B1-like cells), whereas carotid plaques had higher proportions of inflammatory foam cell-like macrophages and monocytes. Our findings highlight important plaque niche-specific immunologic signatures that underlie comparative femoral plaque stability.
